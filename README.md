# Overview

Supplementary material for the publication of Gerrit Toenges and Antje Jahn-Eimermacher (2019): Computational issues in fitting joint frailty models for recurrent events with an associated terminal event, *Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine*. 

The supplementary material contains SAS-macros for the generation and analysis of joint frailty data, along with comprehensive manuals.  

- The SAS-file "Macro Joint Frailty" allows to fit various parametric joint frailty models and is documented in the pdf-file "Macro Joint Frailty Manual"  
- The SAS-file "Macro Simulation" allows to generate datasets from a joint frailty model and is documented in the pdf-file "Macro Simulation Manual"
